This repository contains code used when experimenting with Layer-Selective Rank Reduction (LASER) [1] in the context of reinforcement learning framework. In the paper, the authors described that using the Low-Rank aproxximation on the Decision Transformer gives 3% increase in the performance on the Sokoban task. However there is no discussion on the performance delta in the context of control problems with continous action and observation spaces.
